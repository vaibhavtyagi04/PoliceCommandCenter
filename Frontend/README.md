# 🚨 Police Command Center

An interactive web-based application built using **React.js**, designed to manage emergency response operations for citizens and police departments. This system allows seamless coordination between citizens and law enforcement through modern, responsive dashboards.

---

## 🌐 Overview

The **Police Command Center** provides two main portals:

* **Citizen Dashboard** – Enables users to report emergencies, view alerts, and request help.
* **Police Dashboard** – Allows officers to monitor citizen reports, track live incidents, and manage response priorities.

This project was originally developed using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later refactored into a **React-based SPA (Single Page Application)** for better modularity, reusability, and scalability.
